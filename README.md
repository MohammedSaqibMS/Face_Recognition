# Face Recognition Using Deep Learning ðŸ“¸ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the **Face Recognition Project**, a comprehensive implementation of a face recognition system using deep learning techniques. This project demonstrates the application of neural networks for facial feature encoding and recognition.

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project provides an end-to-end implementation of a face recognition system:
- **Face Verification**: Determines if two images are of the same person.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies a person from a database of encodings.

Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Python, it utilizes the **Inception V2** architecture and incorporates the **Triplet Loss Function** for robust feature extraction and comparison.

# üßë‚Äçüíª Face Recognition System

Welcome to the **Face Recognition System** repository! This project leverages deep learning techniques for face verification and recognition using the power of convolutional neural networks and pre-trained models.

## üöÄ Overview

This project provides an end-to-end implementation of a face recognition system:
1. **Face Verification**: Determines if two images are of the same person.
2. **Face Recognition**: Identifies a person from a database of encodings.

Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Python, it utilizes the **Inception V2 architecture** and incorporates the **Triplet Loss Function** for robust feature extraction and comparison. 

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Uses Inception V2 blocks for efficient feature learning.
- **Custom Triplet Loss**: Ensures minimal distance between similar faces and maximal distance between dissimilar faces.
- **Pre-trained Weights**: Includes pre-trained FaceNet weights for encoding faces into 128-dimensional embeddings.
- **Real-world Applications**: Build security systems, smart door unlock mechanisms, and more!

## üìö Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Keras

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition.git
   cd face-recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and place the pre-trained FaceNet weights in the `weights/` directory.

### Running the Project
- To run the face verification script:
  ```bash
  python verify.py
  ```

- To encode a new image and add it to the database:
  ```python
  database['new_person'] = img_to_encoding('path/to/image.jpg', FRmodel)
  ```

## üß† Key Concepts

### Triplet Loss
The triplet loss ensures:
- **Anchor-Positive Similarity**: Images of the same person are closer in feature space.
- **Anchor-Negative Dissimilarity**: Images of different people are farther apart.

Formula:
```math
L = max(||f(a) - f(p)||^2 - ||f(a) - f(n)||^2 + Œ±, 0)
```

### Face Embeddings
Each face is encoded into a **128-dimensional vector**. The Euclidean distance between vectors determines similarity.
